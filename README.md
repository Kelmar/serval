This is currently an experiamental language that I'm developing.  That may change in the future.

# Goals
## Language
* C/C++/C# like syntax
* Easy to interface with hardware at a low level (OS/Driver Development)
  * Pointers & Refrences
  * Pointer arithmatic
* Easy to interface with C/C++ (Not sure how yet)
* Stack based objects
* Reflection
* Events
* Lambdas & Closures
* Generics (Not templates)
* Interfaces
* Strongly typed
* Const correctness like C++ (readonly objects checked at compile time)
* Operator overloading
* Async programming (user space threads (i.e. C# tasks))

## Standard Library
* Common collection library (lists, maps, arrays, etc. with common interface.)
* Thread constructs

# Syntax

At the moment the syntax has not be solidified for anything.  It will be C/C++ like, but may include
some useful constructs from other languages such as Ruby, TypeScript, or D.
